## What computer do we need

This course is an agent programming course.

### What we intend to run
- A small neural network simple model (not LLM) - to get to feel deep learning.
- Maybe, Some **VERY** small LLM models, the king no GPU is needed. We'll run the rest on cloud solutions
- Python locally installed libraries:
**This is just a list!**  
**There may be more!!!**  
**We probably not use all of these!!!!!**  
  - jupyter-lab
  - NumPy
  - matplotlib
  - PyTorch, torch (PyTorch), torchvision
  - tensorflow, keras
  - transformers (HuggingFace), tokenizers, sentencepiece
  - langchain, langgraph
  - chromadb, pinecone
  - openai, anthropic, google-generativeai, boto3 (AWS)
  - requests
  - . . .



### System
So - no GPU needed.  
But a modern system will make life easier for you.

This is NOT a complete Python subjects list.
This is a minimal knowledge you should know to get along with the course.


## MAKE SURE YOU KNOW THESE PYTHON DETAILS

### types and values
- types: **int**, **float**, **str**, **list**, **tuple**, **dict**, **set**
- every value in Python is an object (with a type which is a class)
- every object has an id
- All variables (or NAMES as Python calls them) are really references
- Some types are immutable (int, float, str, tuple. . .)
- **dict/set** is based on a hash table
- Use indexing for **str**, **list**, **dict**  
(e.g: 'hello'[2]  -> ‘l’)
- Use slicing   (e.g: names[3:7] )
- Use the **del** statement
- Use **list/dict** comprehensions
- Use tuples to pack/unpack values
- Understand comparisons

### Control flow:
- understand the **bool** type
- Understand boolean operators: **and**, **or**, **not**
- Use **if/elif/else**
- What is the **range()** function? Object?
explain **range** objects when not inside a loop
- Know **while** loops
- know **for** loops
- Use **else** for loops
- use: **break**, **continue**
- Use **pass **

### Functions
- Creating functions using **def**
- def is a runtime construct
- functions are objects and their names are like all Python names (i.e variables)
- Functions as first class citizens:
Pass function as an argument, keep functions inside lists/dicts values..

### Function parameters/arguments
- Know the difference: argument vs parameter
- prameters with/without default values
- positional arguments
- keyword arguments
- Use / and * to define limits for:
  - positional-only arguments
  - positional or keyword arguments
- Use *name parameter to pack arguments into a tuple
- Use **name parmeter to pack arguments into a dictionary


### Modules
- modules are also objects
- import happenes in runtime
- import modules
- import from modules
- get to know usefull standard library modules
- create a virtual environment, activate and install into it
(the is the venv built in module)

### Input and Output
- Understand the bytes and bytesarray types
- read from and write to binary files
- Understand: ASCII, Unicode (UTF-16, UTF-8)
- read from and write to text files

### Exceptions
- syntax errors vs exceptions
- Handle exceptions with try and except

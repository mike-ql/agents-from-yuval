    "#### 1. Define the Schema\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you must define what the \"structured\" part looks like. In modern LangChain, we use **Pydantic** classes to create a blueprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Class to define:** `Ingredient` (attributes: `name`, `amount`, `unit`)\n",
    "* **Container class:** `RecipeOutput` (attribute: a `list` of `Ingredient` objects)\n",

    "When you invoke this graph, the response will not be a string of text. It will be a **native Python object** (an instance of `RecipeOutput`) that looks like this:\n",

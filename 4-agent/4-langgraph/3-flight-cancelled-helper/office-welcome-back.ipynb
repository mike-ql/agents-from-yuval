    "### Exercise: The Office Welcome-Back Mission\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **The Scenario**\n",
    "Suzy from the QA team is returning from maternity leave, and the office wants to mark the occasion. You are designing a **Gift Coordinator Agent** tasked with a simple but high-stakes mission: gather enough funds from the team to get her a great gift. If the collection falls short, the agent must pivot to a thoughtful backup plan so she doesn't return to an empty desk.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **The Objective**\n",
    "Your task is to build the decision-making logic for an agent that manages a limited \"collection\" window. The agent must decide whether to keep asking for donations or to wrap up the campaign based on the total amount gathered, (maximum two collection attempts).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **The Workflow Logic**\n",
    "The agent must navigate the following sequence to determine Suzy’s welcome-back surprise:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The First Collection:** The agent starts by reaching out to the department. This action returns a random contribution amount.\n",
    "2. **The Threshold Check:**\n",
    "  - **Success:** If the amount collected is **$60 or more**, the agent immediately stops and proceeds to the \"Success Path.\"\n",
    "  - **Insufficient Funds:** If the amount is **less than $60**, the agent must decide if it has the \"energy\" for one more round.\n",
    "3. **The Final Push (Optional):** If the first round was short, the agent can trigger a second and final collection attempt. The new funds are added to the previous total.\n",
    "4. **Final Decision Node:** \n",
    "  - **Path A (The Gift):** If the total reaches or exceeds the **$60 goal** at any point, the agent triggers the \"Purchase Gift\" action.\n",
    "  - **Path B (The Card):** If, after the second attempt, the total is still **under $60**, the agent must stop and trigger the \"Send Congratulations Card\" action instead.\n",
    "5. **Completion:** The agent reports the final outcome—either the gift or the card—and closes the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Requirements**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Loop Constraints:** The agent is strictly forbidden from calling the collection action more than twice. It must track its \"attempt count\" accurately.\n",
    "* **State Accumulation:** The agent must be able to add new data (the second collection) to its existing knowledge (the first collection) without losing the original value.\n",
    "* **Conditional Branching:** The logic must clearly distinguish between \"Having enough money\" and \"Running out of turns.\"\n"

    "## Exercise: The \"Context-Aware Research & Routing\" Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will build a sophisticated agentic system designed to ingest a complex user request, determine the necessary tools to fulfill it, execute a multi-step research plan, and provide a structured final report. The goal is to move beyond simple \"Chat-with-PDF\" apps and into **autonomous decision-making.**\n",

    "### 1. Python Libraries to Avoid\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure you are building for the current 2026 AI ecosystem, strictly avoid \"legacy\" or \"classic\" patterns. Specifically, do not use:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **LangChain < 1.0 (The \"Classic\" Era):** Avoid `langchain.agents.initialize_agent` or any of the older `ZeroShotAgent` classes. These have been deprecated in favor of the more stable and flexible `create_agent`.\n",
    "* **Implicit Chains:** Avoid using the `LLMChain` or basic pipe `|` operators for complex logic. Use **LangGraph** for any workflow that requires state, loops, or conditional branching.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Recommended Model\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, use **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** or **Claude 3 Opus** (or the updated **Claude 4.6** if available in your environment).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Reason:** These models currently exhibit the highest \"Agentic Reasoning\" scores, specifically regarding tool-calling accuracy and the ability to follow complex system instructions without \"forgetting\" the middle of the prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Required Output Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent must not simply return a string of text. It must return a **Typed Dictionary** or **Pydantic Model** with the following keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Key | Type | Description |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| `thought_process` | `List[str]` | A step-by-step log of the agent's internal reasoning. |\n",
    "| `sources_consulted` | `List[dict]` | A list of URLs or tool-outputs used, including a \"reliability score\" for each. |\n",
    "| `final_summary` | `Markdown String` | The cohesive answer to the user query. |\n",
    "| `confidence_score` | `Float (0.0 - 1.0)` | The agent's self-assessment of the accuracy of the result. |\n",
    "| `next_suggested_steps` | `List[str]` | Recommendations for the user to verify or extend the research. |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Prompting & System Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent \"agent drift\" (where the agent gets lost in a loop), follow these structural guidelines for your prompts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Role-Based Identity:** Clearly define the agent as a \"Senior Technical Researcher and Logic Verifier.\"\n",
    "* **The \"Plan-then-Execute\" Requirement:** Your system prompt should mandate that the agent generates a hidden \"Execution Plan\" before calling its first tool.\n",
    "* **Negative Constraints:** Explicitly list what the agent is **not** allowed to do (e.g., \"Do not hallucinate URLs,\" \"Do not repeat a tool call with the exact same parameters if the first one failed\").\n",
    "* **Reflection Step:** Instruct the agent to perform a \"Self-Correction\" pass. Before finalizing the output, it should compare its `final_summary` against the `sources_consulted` to ensure every claim is grounded in the retrieved data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Step\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you like me to provide a **Troubleshooting Guide** for common agentic loop errors, such as \"Tool Hallucination\" or \"Infinite Iteration\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Introduction to AI Agents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rUKr8JDits)\n",
    "This video provides a comprehensive overview of agentic AI, explaining how it moves beyond basic generation to purposeful, autonomous action—essential context for any class exercise."

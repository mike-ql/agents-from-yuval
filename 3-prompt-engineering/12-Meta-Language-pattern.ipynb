    "## The Meta Language pattern\n",
    "The Meta-Language Prompt Pattern is a sophisticated technique used to bridge the gap between human intent and AI execution by establishing a \"bridge language.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of struggling to describe complex requirements in plain English every time, you define a shorthand, a set of symbols, or a specialized syntax that the AI should follow for the duration of the conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Structure\n",
    "- The Definition: You tell the AI, \"Whenever I use [Symbol/Word], it means [Complex Instruction].\"\n",
    "- The Trigger: You provide the input using that new meta-language.\n",
    "- The Action: The AI translates that shorthand into the complex behavior you defined."

    "**Prompt:**\n",

    "When I type REVISE(lang, code), I want you to check for (1) Security flaws, (2) Big O complexity, and (3) PEP8 compliance.\n",
    "REVISE(Python, def add_nums(x, y): return x+y)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Response:**\n",
    "## Revision Analysis: `add_nums`\n",
    "\n",
    "Your function is a straightforward addition utility. While it’s simple, applying your three criteria reveals a few interesting points regarding Python best practices and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Security Flaws\n",
    "\n",
    "**Status: Low Risk**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Type Safety:** Python is dynamically typed. While `x + y` is safe for integers and strings, it can lead to a **DoS (Denial of Service)** risk if a user passes extremely large integers or deeply nested objects that trigger recursion limits, though that is unlikely in this specific snippet.\n",
    "* **Input Validation:** There is no validation to ensure `x` and `y` are types that *can* be added. For example, `add_nums(5, \"5\")` will raise a `TypeError`, potentially crashing an unhandled process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Big O Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "The complexity depends entirely on the data types passed to the function:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Data Type | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| **Integers/Floats** |  |  |\n",
    "| **Strings (length )** |  |  |\n",
    "| **Lists (length )** |  |  |\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** For standard numeric addition, the operation is constant time. However, if you pass two lists or strings, Python must iterate through the elements to create the new combined object, resulting in linear complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. PEP8 Compliance\n",
    "\n",
    "Your current code: `def add_nums(x, y): return x+y`\n",
    "**Issues found:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Whitespace:** PEP8 requires spaces around operators (e.g., `x + y` instead of `x+y`) to improve readability.\n",
    "* **Blank Lines:** Functions should generally be surrounded by two blank lines if part of a module.\n",
    "* **Docstrings:** While not a strict syntax error, PEP8/PEP257 suggests documenting function behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Revised Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the PEP8-compliant version with basic type hinting for better security and clarity:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "def add_nums(x: int, y: int) -> int:\n",

    "## The Persona Pattern\n",
    "The Persona Pattern is arguably the most fundamental and effective technique for controlling Large Language Model (LLM) output\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to use\n",
    "To use this pattern, your prompt should make the following fundamental contextual statements:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Act as Persona X\n",
    "Perform task Y\n",
    "```\n",
    "### What we get from it\n",
    "- Domain Specificity & Jargon\n",
    "A generic prompt often yields a generic \"Wikipedia-style\" answer.  \n",
    "A persona prompt unlocks specific vocabulary.\n",
    "- Example:  \n",
    "  - **Generic Prompt**:  \n",
    "  \"Explain how a bicycle works.\"  \n",
    "  Result:  \n",
    "  Explains pedals and wheels.  \n",
    "  - **Persona Prompt**:  \n",
    "  \"Act as a Physicist. Explain how a bicycle works.\"  \n",
    "  Result:  \n",
    "  Discusses angular momentum, gyroscopic effects, and gear ratios.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why it works\n",
    "LLMs are trained on massive datasets containing conflicting information, styles, and logic (from Reddit threads to academic papers). When you prompt a raw model, it averages this data.  \n",
    "By assigning a persona, you are effectively \"steering\" the model toward a specific cluster of its latent space (its internal map of knowledge).\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Personas can I use\n",
    "These are just examples.\n",
    "- 1. Professional & Technical Personas\n",
    "  - The Senior Software Architect\n",
    "  - The Cyber Security Auditor\n",
    "  - The Financial Analyst\n",
    "  - The Research Scientist\n",
    "- 2. Educational & Mentorship Personas\n",
    "  - The Socratic Tutor: Instead of giving answers, this persona asks guiding questions to help you reach the conclusion yourself\n",
    "  - The \"EL5\" (Explain Like I'm 5) Specialist\n",
    "  - The Language Immersion Partner: Acts as a native speaker of a specific language, correcting your grammar while maintaining a conversation.\n",
    "- 3. Creative & Stylistic Personas\n",
    "  - The Investigative Journalist\n",
    "  - The Avant-Garde Poet\n",
    "  - The Screenwriter\n",
    "  - The Grumpy Editor: Critiques your writing harshly, looking for fluff and grammatical errors.\n",
    "- 4. Problem-Solving & Strategic Personas\n",
    "  - The \"Devil’s Advocate\": Specifically looks for reasons why your idea might fail or why the opposing view is correct.\n",
    "  - The Project Manager: Breaks down a vague goal into a timeline, milestones, and a Resource Allocation Matrix.\n",
    "  - The Growth Hacker: Focuses on low-cost, high-impact strategies for marketing and scaling.\n",
    "- 5. Rhetorical & Historical Personas\n",
    "  - The Stoic Philosopher: Provides advice based on emotional regulation and logic (e.g., Marcus Aurelius).\n",
    "  - The Historical Figure: Answers as if they were Leonardo da Vinci or Napoleon, using the knowledge available in their era.\n",
    "- pro tip: The \"Multipersona\" Pattern  \n",
    "You can even ask the AI to act as a panel of experts.  \n",
    "For example:  \n",
    "```\n",
    "Act as a panel consisting of a UI Designer, a Backend Engineer, and a Product Manager. \n",
    "Debate the pros and cons of my app idea.\n",
    "```"

    "* **The Dark Zone (Pyrolysis):** The area right around the wick. This is actually vaporized wax that hasn't started burning yet because oxygen hasn't reached it.\n",
    "* **The Luminous Zone (Incomplete Combustion):** The bright yellow part. Here, the wax breaks down into tiny carbon particles called **soot**. These particles get so hot they glow (incandescence), providing the light you see.\n",

    "\n",
    "The paraffin wax () reacts with oxygen () to release energy, carbon dioxide, and water:\n",
    "$$C_{25}H_{52} + 38O_2 \\rightarrow 25CO_2 + 26H_2O + \\text{Energy}$$\n",

    "## Few-Shot pattern\n",
    "Few-shot prompting is a technique where you provide a generative model with a small set of examples (shots) to demonstrate the specific task, format, or tone you want it to emulate.\n",
    "\n",
    "While large language models are often capable of \"Zero-shot\" performance (following a direct instruction without examples), few-shot prompting is the \"show, don't just tell\" approach that significantly improves accuracy for complex or niche tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "The pattern typically consists of three components:\n",
    "- The Task Description: (optional) A brief instruction of what the model should do.\n",
    "- The Examples: A series of input-output pairs.\n",
    "- The New Input: The actual data you want the model to process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Few-Shot Prompting?\n",
    "- Consistency: It forces the model to adhere to a specific output format (e.g., JSON, XML, or specific shorthand) without needing long, wordy instructions.\n",
    "- Nuance: It helps the model pick up on subtle stylistic choices, like sarcasm, professional jargon, or a specific brand voice.\n",
    "- Reduced \"Hallucination\": By providing a clear guardrail of examples, the model is less likely to deviate into creative but incorrect responses.\n",
    "- Complex Logic: It allows you to demonstrate \"Chain of Thought\" reasoning by showing the model how to solve a problem step-by-step before asking it to solve a new one."

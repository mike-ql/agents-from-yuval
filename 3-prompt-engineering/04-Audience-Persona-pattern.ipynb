    "## The Audience Persona pattern\n",
    "An audience persona (often called a buyer persona or marketing persona) is a fictionalized, research-based character that represents a specific segment of your target audience. Think of it as a \"composite sketch\" of your ideal customer or follower.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of looking at a broad group like \"people who like coffee,\" a persona zooms in on \"Early-Bird Elias,\" a 34-year-old remote software engineer who values organic beans and fast delivery because he starts work at 6:00 AM.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to use\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the following pattern:  \n",
    "```\n",
    "Explain X to me. \n",
    "Assume that I am Persona Y.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use It?\n",
    "I would be a good way to calibrate the output's complexity, tone, and utility by defining a specific consumer you have in mind.\n"

    "#### Example 1\n",
    "**Prompt:** \n",
    "```\n",
    "Explain audience persona prompt pattern to me.\n",
    "Assume I am an agentic AI course student.\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Response:**\n",
    "In the world of prompt engineering, the **Audience Persona Pattern** is a structural technique used to bridge the gap between \"what\" you want the AI to say and \"how\" the information should be received.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since you're studying agentic AI, think of this pattern as a way to **calibrate the output's complexity, tone, and utility** by defining a specific consumer for the information. It forces the LLM to filter its vast knowledge base through a lens that matches the recipient's expertise.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why the Audience Persona Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Without a defined audience, an LLM defaults to a \"generalist\" tone—often a polite, medium-complexity Wikipedia style. For an autonomous agent, this lack of specificity can lead to \"hallucinations of intent,\" where the agent provides correct information that is nonetheless useless to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Core Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "> **\"Explain [Topic] to [Specific Audience Persona]. Focus on [Relevant Details] and use [Tone/Level of Language].\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## How it Differs from the \"Act as\" Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "It is easy to confuse this with the **Persona Pattern** (where the AI *is* the expert), but they serve opposite ends of the communication pipe:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Persona Pattern:** Sets the **Source** (e.g., \"Act as a Senior DevOps Engineer\").\n",
    "* **Audience Persona Pattern:** Sets the **Destination** (e.g., \"Explain this deployment error to a non-technical Project Manager\").\n",

    "## Strategic Implementation for Agentic AI\n",

    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| **Technical Lead** | Implementation details, edge cases | Jargon-heavy, concise,  notation |\n",

    "## The \"Agentic\" Twist: Dynamic Audience Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "When building agents, you don't just hard-code one audience. You can instruct an agent to **infer the audience persona** from the user's initial query.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **If the user asks:** \"Why is this broke?\" -> Agent adopts a \"Beginner\" audience profile.\n",
    "* **If the user asks:** \"Is there a conflict in the peer dependency tree?\" -> Agent adopts an \"Expert\" audience profile.\n",

    "As a newly appointed bank manager, your attire is no longer just a dress code—it is a tool for establishing authority, building trust with high-value clients, and leading your team by example. You need a suit that works as hard as you do, transitioning from morning briefings to evening networking without losing its edge.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 1. The Psychology of Authority\n",

    "In banking, perception is reality. A well-tailored suit communicates attention to detail and fiscal responsibility. Our suits utilize a structured shoulder and a clean \"V\" taper, which non-verbally signals leadership and confidence to both your staff and your superiors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Fabric Engineering for the Long Day\n",
    "\n",
    "Management often means 10-hour days. We use high-twist **Merino wool** (Super 120s to 150s), which offers a unique balance of luxury and resilience.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Natural Stretch:** Moves with you during presentations or client lunches.\n",
    "* **Crease Resistance:** Maintains a crisp, professional look from your 8:00 AM arrival to your final sign-off.\n",
    "* **Breathability:** Keeps you cool under the pressure of quarterly reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. The \"Power\" Aesthetic\n",
    "\n",
    "For a bank manager, the goal is \"conservative excellence.\" We focus on timeless details that command respect:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Midnight Navy & Charcoal Palettes:** The gold standard for financial professionals.\n",
    "* **Hand-Finished Pick Stitching:** A subtle mark of quality that peers will notice.\n",

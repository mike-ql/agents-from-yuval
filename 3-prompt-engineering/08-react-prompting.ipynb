    "## ReAct pattern\n",
    "In the world of Generative AI, the React (Reasoning and Acting) pattern is a framework that allows LLMs to solve complex tasks by combining \"chain-of-thought\" reasoning with real-world actions (like searching the web or running code).\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of just guessing an answer, the model follows a structured loop: Think, Act, Observe.\n",
    "\n",
    "link:\n",
    "[ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629)\n",
    "\n",
    "### How the ReAct Loop Works\n",
    "The pattern typically follows a repeating cycle until the model reaches a final conclusion.  \n",
    "It helps reduce hallucinations because the model must ground its reasoning in actual data retrieved from its \"actions.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pattern:\n",
    "- Thought: The model describes what it needs to do and why.\n",
    "- Action: The model selects a specific tool to use (e.g., a Google Search or a Calculator).\n",
    "- Observation: The model \"reads\" the result of that action.\n",
    "- Repeat: Based on the observation, the model starts a new \"Thought\" process until the task is complete."

    "#### Example 1\n",
    "**Prompt:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "You are an assistant that solves complex problems using a \"Reason + Act\" (ReAct) cycle. \n",
    "From now on, for every request, you must follow this structured format:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. THOUGHT: Describe your reasoning about the current situation and what your next step should be.\n",
    "2. ACTION: Identify the specific tool to use. Format this as Action: [tool_name] with [input].\n",
    "3. OBSERVATION: (This will be provided to you after the action is taken).\n",
    "4. REPEAT: Continue the cycle until you have enough information.\n",
    "5. FINAL ANSWER: Provide the final conclusion to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "AVAILABLE TOOLS:\n",
    "- search_web: Use this for current events or factual data.\n",
    "- calculator: Use this for any math or age calculations.\n",
    "- internal_database: Use this to look up company-specific documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rules:\n",
    "- Searching the web is a tool. Do not do it if you do not follow the ACTION step\n",
    "- Never skip the THOUGHT step.\n",
    "- Never skip ANY step\n",
    "- Only perform ONE action at a time.\n",
    "- If the observation provides insufficient data, refine your THOUGHT and try again.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Response:**\n",
    "I can certainly adopt this \"Reason + Act\" (ReAct) cycle for our future problem-solving. This structured approach is great for transparency and ensuring we don't miss any critical steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’d like me to use this specific ReAct format for all our future interactions, I recommend adding this requirement to your **'Your instructions for Gemini'** [here](https://gemini.google.com/saved-info). You can paste these exact steps and rules there to ensure that every time we start a new conversation, I already know to use this framework without you having to remind me.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the first complex problem you'd like me to tackle using this cycle?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Is visiting Ukrain capital dangerous this week?\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Response:**\n",
    "1. **THOUGHT**: The user is asking about the safety of visiting Kyiv, Ukraine, specifically for the current week (late January 2026). I need to check current travel advisories, security alerts, and any recent reports of military activity or infrastructure issues in Kyiv to provide an accurate assessment. My first step will be to search for the most recent travel advisories and news regarding Kyiv's safety.\n",
    "2. **ACTION**: Action: [search_web] with [\"current safety situation Kyiv Ukraine January 2026\", \"travel advisory Ukraine January 2026\", \"Kyiv air strike news January 2026\"]\n",
    "3. **OBSERVATION**: (This was provided in the previous step through the search results). The search results indicate:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Major governments (US, UK, Australia, Canada) have issued \"Do Not Travel\" (Level 4) advisories for all of Ukraine, including Kyiv, as of January 24, 2026.\n",
    "* The security situation is volatile due to the ongoing Russian invasion.\n",
    "* As of January 21, 2026, nearly 60% of Kyiv was without power due to aerial strikes.\n",
    "* There is a persistent risk of missile and drone attacks, with alerts reissued in early January regarding significant air attack threats.\n",
    "* Martial law is in effect, and curfews are strictly enforced.\n",
    "* Airspace is closed; travel is only possible via land (train/bus/car) and is subject to disruption.\n",
    "* Winter temperatures (dropping below -20°C) combined with energy infrastructure damage pose significant humanitarian risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **REPEAT**: I have sufficient information to answer the user's request without further actions.\n",
    "5. **FINAL ANSWER**:\n",
    "Visiting Kyiv this week is considered **extremely dangerous**. As of January 24, 2026, major international governments, including the US, UK, and Australia, maintain a **Level 4: Do Not Travel** advisory for all of Ukraine.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary risks currently include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Active Military Conflict:** Kyiv remains a frequent target for Russian missile and drone strikes. These can occur with little warning and target civilian infrastructure.\n",
    "* **Infrastructure Collapse:** As of earlier this week, roughly **60% of the city was without power**. Combined with temperatures that can drop below **-20°C**, this creates life-threatening conditions regarding heating and water supplies.\n",
    "* **Martial Law:** A nationwide state of emergency is in place. This includes strictly enforced curfews, ID checks, and restricted movement.\n",
    "* **Limited Assistance:** Most embassies have restricted operations. If you get into trouble, your home country's ability to provide consular or evacuation assistance is extremely limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:** It is strongly advised against traveling to Kyiv at this time. If you are already there, travel advisories suggest leaving immediately if it is safe to do so and staying near hardened shelters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you like me to look up the current land border crossing wait times or specific safety protocols for those currently in the city?\n",

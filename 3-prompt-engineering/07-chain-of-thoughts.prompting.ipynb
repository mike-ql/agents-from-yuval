    "## Chain of Thoughts pattern\n",
    "In the world of AI prompting, Chain of Thought (CoT) is essentially asking the model to \"show its work.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of jumping straight from a question to an answer—which can lead to \"hallucinations\" or logic errors—CoT encourages the AI to walk through a series of intermediate reasoning steps. It’s the difference between a student shouting out \"42!\" and a student writing out the entire equation on the chalkboard.\n",

    "#### How It Works\n",
    "Standard prompting provides a \"Input -> Output\" structure. CoT adds a \"Reasoning\" layer in the middle.\n",

    "This is the simplest version. You don't even have to give examples; you just add a specific phrase to your prompt.\n",

    "\n",
    "Why it works: This triggers the model to break the problem into smaller, logical chunks before committing to a final answer.\n",

    "##  The Question Refinement Pattern\n",
    "The Question Refinement Pattern is a prompt engineering technique designed to create a collaborative loop between you and the AI.  \n",
    "Instead of hoping the AI understands a vague request, you instruct it to refine your questions before answering them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Use\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "From now on, whenever I ask a question, suggest a better version of the question to use instead\n",
    "(Optional) Prompt me if I would like to use the better version instead\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### What we get from it\n",
    "- Reduces Hallucinations:  \n",
    "By forcing the AI to clarify context, it is less likely to \"guess\" and provide incorrect information.\n",
    "- Saves Time:  \n",
    "It prevents the \"prompt-and-fix\" cycle where you have to keep asking follow-up questions because the first answer was too broad.\n",
    "- Educational:  \n",
    "It helps you learn how to write better prompts by seeing how the AI reconstructs your basic ideas into structured queries.\n"

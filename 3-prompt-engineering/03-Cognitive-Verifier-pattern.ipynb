    "## The Cognitive Verifier pattern\n",
    "The **Cognitive Verifier** is a prompt engineering pattern designed to improve the reasoning capabilities of a Large Language Model (LLM) by forcing it to break down a complex problem into smaller, verifiable sub-questions before arriving at a final answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it as a \"sanity check\" phase where the model acts as its own investigative consultant. Instead of rushing to a conclusion, it identifies what information it *actually* needs to confirm to ensure the final output is accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to use\n",
    "\n",
    "Your prompt structure should look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **System Prompt:** When I ask a question, follow these steps:\n",
    "> 1. Create 3–4 sub-questions that would help verify the facts needed for a complete answer.\n",
    "> 2. Answer those questions.\n",
    "> 3. Provide the final response based on those answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How the Pattern Works\n",
    "\n",
    "The pattern typically follows a three-step internal logic:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify Sub-questions:** The LLM looks at the user's initial prompt and generates a series of underlying questions that must be answered to solve the main problem.\n",
    "2. **Verify (The \"Cognitive\" Step):** The model answers those sub-questions individually. This grounds the model in specific facts and reduces \"hallucination\" by creating a logical trail of evidence.\n",
    "3. **Synthesize:** The model uses the verified facts from step two to provide the final response to the original query.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use It?\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Reduces Hallucination:** By forcing the model to answer smaller, factual questions first, it is less likely to make a leap of logic that results in false information.\n",
    "* **Handles Complexity:** It is excellent for multi-layered queries (e.g., legal analysis, complex technical troubleshooting, or historical comparisons) where a single-step answer might miss nuances.\n",
    "* **Improved Accuracy:** Much like \"Chain of Thought\" prompting, this provides the model with more \"computational space\" to work through the logic.\n"

    "### Example 1\n",
    "**Prompt:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Whenever I give you a task, ask 3-5 questions that will better refine that task at hand.\n",
    "Then answer those questions specifically, and only then combine the answers to form a final answer to the task\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Response:**\n",
    "That sounds like an excellent way to ensure we’re hitting the mark. I’ll adopt this \"Refine, Solve, Synthesize\" workflow for your tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make sure I apply this approach to every task you give me from now on, you can add this specific preference to **'Your instructions for Gemini'** [here](https://gemini.google.com/saved-info). This ensures that even in new conversations, I’ll remember to use this structured method for you.\n",

    "Since you haven't provided a specific task yet, I'm ready when you are! What is the first task you'd like to tackle using this new process?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "I want to learn AI\n",
    "```\n",

    "**Response:**\n",
    "To get this journey started right, let’s apply our new process. Here are the questions to help refine exactly what \"learning AI\" looks like for you:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 1: Refining the Task\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **What is your current technical background?** (e.g., Are you a total beginner, or do you already know some Python or math?)\n",
    "2. **What is your primary goal?** (e.g., Do you want to build apps using existing tools, understand the deep theory/math, or pivot your career into data science?)\n",
    "3. **How much time can you realistically commit?** (e.g., A few hours a week as a hobby, or an intensive daily study schedule?)\n",
    "4. **What type of AI interests you most?** (e.g., Generative AI like ChatGPT, Computer Vision, or Predictive Analytics?)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 2: Specific Answers\n",
    "\n",
    "*Since I don't have your specific answers yet, I will provide answers based on a **standard \"Professional Transition\" path**, which is the most common starting point:*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Background:** Assuming a beginner level with a basic comfort in logic but no deep programming or calculus knowledge.\n",
    "2. **Goal:** To understand how AI works and gain the skills to build functional AI-powered projects.\n",
    "3. **Time:** Approximately 5–10 hours per week (a sustainable \"marathon\" pace).\n",
    "4. **Interests:** Large Language Models (LLMs) and the fundamentals of Machine Learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 3: The Final Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on those answers, here is your foundational roadmap to learning AI:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Step 1: The Language of AI (Weeks 1-4):** Start with **Python**. It is the industry standard. Focus on libraries like `NumPy` and `Pandas` for data manipulation.\n",
    "* **Step 2: Understanding the \"Brain\" (Weeks 5-8):** Take a high-level theory course. Andrew Ng’s \"AI For Everyone\" (non-technical) or his \"Machine Learning Specialization\" (technical) are the gold standards.\n",
    "* **Step 3: Prompt Engineering & APIs (Weeks 9-10):** Learn how to work with existing models. Explore the OpenAI or Gemini APIs to understand how to integrate \"intelligence\" into a script without building a model from scratch.\n",
    "* **Step 4: Practical Projects (Ongoing):** Build something small. Create a personal bot that summarizes your emails or a tool that classifies images of your favorite hobby.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Would you like me to adjust this plan based on your actual answers to the questions in Phase 1?**\n"

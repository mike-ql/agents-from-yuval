    "## The Template pattern\n",
    "The Template Prompt Pattern is a structural technique used to ensure an AI produces output in a very specific format or style. It works by providing the AI with a \"skeleton\" or a \"fill-in-the-blank\" structure, which the AI then completes based on the information you provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it Works\n",
    "Instead of giving a vague instruction like \"Write a product description,\" you provide a template with placeholders (usually denoted by brackets like [ITEM] or <TOPIC>).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Three Components\n",
    "- The Context: You tell the AI what role it is playing.\n",
    "- The Template: The exact structure you want the output to follow.\n",
    "- The Variables: The specific data points you want the AI to use to fill that structure."
